    <li> I was raised by my grandmother until I was six </li>
    <li> I was named by my birth father. The name nain was atually a small town near the gate of which Jesus raised to life a widow's son </li></ol>
    <li>  When moving to The United States I lived in Pheonix with some family
        <ol type="a"> 
        <li> Mom Married a man to come to the US things didnt work out too well
        <li> We then lived with some other family in Little Village. 
        <li> Mom met Step dad and around 2008 we mmoved into the Brighton Park Neighborhood</li>
        <li> Ive ussually never had friends as a kid but I got lucky to meet some great people that approached the little shy me.
        <li> because of such a crappy neighborhood I always stayed inside alone and just played on my PS2 which is where my love for gaming stems</li></ol>
        <li> In highschool (Whitney M. Young Magnet Highschool) a lot of things changed</li>
         <ol type="a"> 
         <li> I made friends just not that many but only really after my Freshman year
         <li> I had more freedom to being out compared to when I was small because my neighborhood is just trash
         <li> Ive become less shy over the course of the four years
         <li> I got a lot more into biking and as far as interests I run 2 clubs Board Game Club and Video Game Club</li></ol>
</ol>

    <h1><em>WHAT 2018 be aBout</em></h1>
    <br> 
    <p>My physical goals or whatever this means would pertain more to just biking, ive probably talked about biking a lot but like its a quality thing to do</p>
    <p> Emotional goals, personally I want to stop being so negative. Kinda want to stop hating myself in general. 2018 started out rough I just hope it gets better. I'll try to have a posotive outlook.</p>
    <p> Social goals, I'm trying to spend as much time I can just hanging out with my friends and those I care about before everything starts changing and I end up in this whole adult life thing</p>
